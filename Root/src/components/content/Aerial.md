# Aerial LA

While working on [The Real Cost of Freeways in LA](https://youtu.be/HS6WrJZKbjs) I became obsessed with historic aerial photos. They were fascinating to stare at - but the process of interacting with them was terrible. Some medium format scans could be up to 70mb.  

I ended up falling down a rabbit hole reading about orthophotos, and put together a python script to extract [UCSB's Aerial photos](https://mil.library.ucsb.edu/ap_images/), attatch gps metadata, and then run through a piece of software called ODM mainly used for compiling drone flyovers of farmer's fields to create raster layers.

This project is still a work in progress, the goal is to build out a library of historical LA orthophotos that can be easily accessed, explored, and downloaded for free.

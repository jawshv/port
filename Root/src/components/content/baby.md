# Baby Music Video

In 2020 I spent 2 months animating a [music video](https://youtu.be/qt6aOic4OXk) for my friend Merce Lemon. It ended up as a great exercise in color, texture, and how much time it takes to make simple things move.

`initial draws used to help find the project look`

The entire project was drawn and animated digitally across 45 photoshop files using a wacom tablet. Shots were compiled in premier and after effects.

If approaching a similar project in the future I'd be much more intentional with planning shots to leverage less motion - animation is a great vehicle to do a lot with a little.

# The Real Cost of Freeways in LA

<html><div class="red"></html>

 In the spring of 2021 I researched, wrote, and edited a [10 minute documentary](https://youtu.be/HS6WrJZKbjs) for SFA on the impacts of LA County freeway building. Ultimately, it became a coalition effort under the name [Destruction for Nada](https://www.destructionfornada.com/) with the goal of defunding Metro's planned freeway widenings.

The video has over 75,000 views, has been referenced by Metro staff, and even shared amongst [Caltrans executive staff](https://youtu.be/Z5idvfmEq5A?t=2930).

Notably, for this project we
* used census data to created the first estimate for total historical highway project displacement in LA County

* compiled historic aerial photography to capture neighborhoods just before highway expansions took place and animate as houses were replaced by ROW 

* read enviormental reviews of planned projects to complile projected thier costs and lane mile additions - then worked with UC Davis researchers to estimate corresponding increases in vehicle miles traveled and CO2 emissions

Outside of research, editing this video was a great exercise in motion graphics - especially finding interesting ways to animate graphs, charts, and maps. Building all the graphics required 52 seperate after effects compositions.

## Aerial Photos

I wanted to create a visceral feeling of the very real erasure freeway expansion caused. By collaging aerial images from [UCSB's Aerial Library](https://mil.library.ucsb.edu/ap_images/) I was able to show individual sections of the County pre-freeway, then using after effects could animate masks of the present day freeway ROW over top. Ultimately over 60gb of aerial photos were collected for the video.

## Estimating Displacement

One question I kept coming back to while researching the video was "how many people has this impacted" - unable to find an external estimate we set out to solve in house. 

The methodology we settled on was clipping existing freeway ROW to the decennial census tract density closest to the year of the freeway displacement. I wrote a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jawshv/status/1398858616619208706) about why we think our methodology  - with a result of 150,440 people displaced - was probably an undercount.

This meant first manually analayzing every section of freeway construction to figure out the year property acquisition started (note in some cases this happened 20+ years before construction). For references we used a combination of aerial reference photos and [California Highway Journals](https://cdm16436.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16436coll4/search).

# Hive Lighting

As the in-house designer for Hive Lighting, I’ve been responsible for all web and print deliveries. I co-lead art direction and strategy for all marketing content, launching over 15 products including the entirety of Hive’s Omni-Color LED line. At Hive, both design and marketing is often focused on explaining science-heavy subjects in digestible ways, like the nuances of white light curves or how color gamuts play on different camera sensors.

## Hive App Redesign 2020

A fundamental tool for controlling Hive Lighting LEDs is our free App. It's original incarnation was created out-of-house before I joined the team. In fall of 2019, a react-native developer and I started over from scratch, rebuilding and redesigning the App. A month later launching a cross-platform build a with new architecture and front-end in the [Google Play](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiBoarRp9jnAhVGvJ4KHTWsDAoQFjAJegQIBRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.hive_shot%26hl%3Den_US&usg=AOvVaw16qyVclNevpDdOIigoToyl) and [Apple](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiBoarRp9jnAhVGvJ4KHTWsDAoQFjAKegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fhive-shot%2Fid1209171531&usg=AOvVaw099ApqmLHyILUoyUQjr6dE) app stores. 

Improvements were wholistic; a far cleaner and user friendly interface, a library of 100+ sources referencing traditional film-industry gel packs, animatable EFX, a color saving utility, and a number of other behind the scenes changes and user requested features.

The previous app design was confusing - with extraneous information, unclear inputs, and slow refresh rates. Among other problems, it suffered from a complicated update pipeline, no working Android build, and a resulted in unhappy users.

## Hivelighting.com

I've been responsible for regularly improving and maintaining the Hive's (aging) wordpress site for the last few years. As a small team we haven't had bandwidth (or the marketing priority) to completely rebuild her, but we've been able to launch a number of useful redesigns and features.

# Getting LA back to a 30 minute city
 Los Angeles is spending more than any other region in the United States on transit capital projects, almost $5 Billion annually. We have plans for one new subway, three new light rail lines, and five rail extensions. It's a huge investment that prioritizes ribbon cutting mega-projects. By the 2028 Olympics the City of LA wishes to reduce SOV mode share 20%, or to about 50% of all commuter trips.
 
This hypothetical map sees the Los Angeles Mega Region double down on it's transit growth. Leveraging federal, state, and local funding to expand both large scale rail construction, and tactical neighborhood level improvements to bus and mobility infrastructure. By 2050 envisioning a city built on the backbone of the streetcar, defined by the automobile, and remolded into to an urban fabric with world class transportation options, low traffic violence, and healthy air.

The original design of this map was shown on [transitmaps.net](https://www.transitmap.net/los-angeles-2050-josh-vredevoogd/). 

It was then redesigned to include a robust Bus Rapid Transit Network based on a [twitter crowdsourced list](https://twitter.com/Jawshv/status/1178768379261247490).

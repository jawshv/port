 Built in 2019 as a design and research exercise, [Noparkinghere.com](https://noparkinghere.com/) explores the numerous ways Los Angeles parking policy compounds our regions transportation, housing, and environmental challenges. 
 
 I posted the site to twitter expecting a handful of visits - less than a week later it was viewed 26K times and ended up at the top of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20806752). It's since been referenced by local elected officials and candidates regarding policy decisions for parking and land use.

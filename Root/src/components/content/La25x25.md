# LA 25x25

In the fall of 2021 I built and co-wrote [LA25x25.com](https://la25x25.com/) with SFA, this report is a policy ask to reallocate 25% of city streets back to people. So far more than 60% of candidates running in 2022 have signed on.

The site is architected in React and uses Contentful as a CMS, serving copy as JSON elempents via GraphQL. Interactive maps were built with Mapbox's JS API. The majority of designing, building, and helping write the site took place over 2 months.

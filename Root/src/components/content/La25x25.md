# LA 25x25

In the fall of 2021 I built and co-wrote [LA25x25.com](https://la25x25.com/). This Streets for All report is a policy ask to reallocate 25% of city streets back to people. So far more than 60% of candidates running in 2022 have signed on.

The site is a long-form report, with embedded charts, maps, card, and interactive elements. I architected 25x25 in React.js and uses Contentful as a CMS, serving copy as JSON elempents via GraphQL. Interactive maps were built with Mapbox's JS API. 

The majority of designing, building, and helping write the site took place over 2 months. I was able to recycle some research from a now canceled personal project [analysing of LA's public space](https://lapublic.space/). There were a number of features I built the backend for but we ran out of bandwidth to actually create content for, including a global language toggle to Spanish, a series of portraits for the "How Lives Would be Transformed" section, and interactive streetscapes to show potential treatment options.
